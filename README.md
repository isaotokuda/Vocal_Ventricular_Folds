# Vocal_Ventricular_Folds
This program (VocalVentricularFolds.c) simulates vocal-ventricular fold co-oscillations. It is written in c-language.

Compile: gcc VocalVentricularFolds.c -o VocalVentricularFolds -lm

Executable file: VocalVentricularFolds

Output: Time-traces of vocal fold opening area, ventricular fold opening area, and glottal airflow are written into the output file "Waveform.txt"
